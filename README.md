This mod adds sliders in the mod setting menu to adjust the ability cooldowns and penalty percentage slider.

This is my first RimWorld mod, doesn't come with much but I do plan to add some things:
- A slider for Ritual penalty so you can adjust the penalty percentage. Done
- A slider for Ritual Cooldown so you can adjust the cooldown in days. Done

Configuration:

You can manually change the amount of penalty percentage from 0% to 100%
You can manually change the amount of days it takes for a ability to cooldown from 0 to 20 days.

Via the ingame Options, Mod Options you can tweak those values.

Compatibility:

- Custom Ritual Framework
  Place Adjustable Ritual Cooldowns above Custom Ritual Framework in your loadorder for my settings to work on mods made for Custom Ritual Framework.
